Hii..

Sir/ Madam,
    For your testing purpose I provide the account numbers and pin records here.

    Account1(Account Number:"123456", Pin:"1234", Balance: 10000.0));

    Account2(Account Number:"987654", Pin:"4321", Balance: 500.0));

   You can also able to check in ATMInterface java file by the In this code,
   we're using a HashMap called accounts to store account information.
   Each account is identified by its account number (e.g., "123456" or "987654") as the key,
   and the Account object (with account number, PIN, and balance) as the value.
